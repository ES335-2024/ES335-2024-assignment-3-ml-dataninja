The decline in performance Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models may be attributed to several factors, including:
1. Overfitting: Initially, the models might have fit the training data well but struggled to generalize to new data, leading to overfitting as the training progressed.
2. Model Complexity: The complexity of the models might have caused them to capture noise or irrelevant patterns in the data, reducing their ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data.
ARMA models, on the other hand, may experience a decline in performance due to:

1. Initial Data Fit: The ARMA model initially captures the linear dependencies in the data well, leading to good performance at the outset.
2. Lack of Adaptation: As the model progresses, it fails to adapt to subtle changes or non-linear patterns in the data, causing performance to deteriorate.
3. Assumption Violations: The underlying assumptions of stationarity and linearity might hold initially but become increasingly violated over time, impacting model accuracy.

MA models may experience:

1. Simplified Representation: The Moving Average (MA) model's straightforward approach effectively captures short-term dependencies in the data, resulting in consistent performance.

2. Stable Forecasting: MA's reliance on past forecast errors allows it to provide reliable predictions, particularly in scenarios with stable data patterns.
